# RoseCRM

RoseCRM, a simple but functional CRM, offers all these advantages, plus through the magic of Apps Script, offers: 

Easy data entry: A standard Google Form provides simple, validated client data entry 
Automatic creation of standard documents and folders: When you submit a form, RoseCRM creates a client folder in a specified root folder, along with a GDoc and GSheet for which you can provide templates.
One-click creation of merged, client-specific docs: Docs like contracts, NDAs, and invoices can be created with values from the client list automatically merged.
Client tab for notes: The client tab records all notes, with the latest note visible in the main sheet.
Customisable: RoseCRM supports adding new columns, to make the main sheet contain all the client data you need.
All actions logged: Every action taken on the sheet by RoseCRM is logged on the Log tab.
